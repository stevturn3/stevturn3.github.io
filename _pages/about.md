I am second year Master's of Science Candiate in the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu">Statistics & Data Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a>. Previously, I graduated (Magna Cum Laude) with a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics & Data Science and two minors (Mathematics & Bioinformatics) from <a href="https://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> in June, 2022. Additionally, during my undergraduate education, I contributed to research within the <a href="https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu">Bioinformatics Department</a> at <a href="https://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a>, worked as a quantitative analyst, and honed my skills in data science, statistics, and computer science. During summer 2023, I completed a summer at <a href="https://adaptivebiotech.com">Adaptive Biotechnologies</a> as a Bioinformatics Analyst Intern. Currently, I am working toward completion of my Master's Thesis and looking for opportunities in the Data Science or Bioinformatics space to continue to contribute to meaningful projects, and develop my skills.
