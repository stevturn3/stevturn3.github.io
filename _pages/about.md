I am a second year Master's of Science Candidate in the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu">Statistics & Data Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> with interests in deep learning and machine learning for prediction, and graphical models for causal inference. Currently, I am working towards completing my Master's Thesis on a hybrid constraint-score structure learning algorithm and working on multiple personal projects. Previously, I graduated (Magna Cum Laude) with a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics & Data Science and two minors (Mathematics & Bioinformatics) from UCLA in June, 2022. Additionally, during my undergraduate education, I contributed to research within the <a href="https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu">Bioinformatics Department</a> at UCLA, worked as a quantitative analyst, and honed my skills in data science, statistics, and computer science. As a Bioinformatics Analyst Intern at Adaptive Biotechnologies during the summer of 2023, I gained valuable industry experience. I'm now actively seeking opportunities in the data science or bioinformatics space, bringing my passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful insights.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and connect with meâ€”I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in data science or bioinformatics.
