I am second year Master's of Science Candiate in the Statistics & Data Science Department at UCLA. Previously, I graduated (Magna Cum Laude) with a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics & Data Science and two minors (Mathematics & Bioinformatics) from UCLA in June, 2022.Additionally, during my undergraduate education, I contributed to research within the Bioinformatics Department at UCLA, worked as a quantitative analyst, and honed my skills in data science, statistics, and computer science. During summer 2023, I completed a summer at <a href="https://adaptivebiotech.com">Adaptive Biotechnologies</a> as a Bioinformatics Analyst Intern. Currently, I am completing working toward completion of my Master's Thesis and looking for opportunities in the Data Science or Bioinformatics space to continue to contribute to meaninful projects, and continue to develop my skills.
